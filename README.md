# Sudoku-Solver

   offer three algorithms to solve sudoku puzzles
  
 	*	Rule based Algorithm 3RA, uses three logic rules to solve puzzle and is the fastest algorithm.
 		The rules are: Cell singles, Cluster singles, Cluster cells traverse exclusions
 	
 	*	NumPass Algorithm, utilizes the rule base algorithm with add-on to guess numbers.
 		This is the second fastest algorithm.
 	
 	*	BackTrack Algorithm (enhanched), utilizes the rule base algorithm as a starting point. There after
 		it will test all possible numbers and will solve any valid puzzle. This is the slowest algorithm.
