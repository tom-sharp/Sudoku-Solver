# Sudoku-Solver

   offer two algorithms to solve sudoku puzzles
  
 	*	Rule based Algorithm 3RA, uses three logic rules to solve puzzle and is the fastest algorithm.
 		The rules are: Cell singles, Cluster singles, Cluster cells traverse exclusions
		Will not be able to solve puzzles with multiple solutions as it uses logic rules
 	 	
 	*	BackTrack Algorithm (enhanched), utilizes the rule base algorithm as a starting point. There after
 		it will test all qualified possible numbers and will solve any valid puzzle.
